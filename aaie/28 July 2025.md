# Weekly Mentor Meeting Summary Notes

**Date:** July 28, 2025  

---

## 1. Project Structure & Meetings
- Weekly meetings will follow a structured format:
  - Updates from pillar leads (Product/Scrum Master)
  - Board reviews and discussions if needed

---

## 2. GitHub Workflow and Pull Request Process
- All contributions must go through GitHub via Pull Requests (PRs):
  - Pick a task from the Planner board and move it to *In Progress*
  - Work on the task in a **feature branch** (one branch per feature, not per person)
  - Create a PR linked to the card
  - Move the card to *Code Review* and assign **two team members** for review
  - Once reviewed and approved by peers, assign to a **senior leader** for review
  - After senior leadership approval, it moves to upstream review by **Nebula** for final merge
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Card assignees are accountable for moving the task to completion
  - Keep card statuses updated throughout
  - Use GitHub links within task cards for transparency

---

## 3. Review Expectations
- **Minimum Review Requirement:** Each team member must perform at least **two peer reviews** to meet eligibility criteria.
- **Turnaround Time:** 2 days for review
  - If not done in time and not negotiated, the reviewer can be replaced.
- No use of the "Complete" button on cards â€” tasks must be moved through board stages.

---

## 4. GitHub Workflow Decision
- Finalized workflow:
  - Forking model + feature branches
  - Repos will contain **main** and **development** branches
  - Pull requests go to **development**, and only upon final review and approval, are rebased to **main**
  - All merges to main handled by **Nebula**

---

## 5. Documentation & Deployment
- All planning and research work should be submitted as `.md` (Markdown) files via PRs.
- These will auto-deploy to a Netlify documentation site using the **Astro** framework.
- **Deployment Check:** Contributors must check Netlify PR preview deployments themselves.

---

## 6. Project Direction Update (from PO Meeting)
- **Key Change:**
  - Phase 1 will focus on **educator-facing features only**.
  - Student-facing features may be added in Phase 2.
- **New Requirements:**
  - Submissions must include:
    - Final file
    - Prompts used
    - AI-generated responses
  - Aim to detect whether significant edits were made by students.
  - Emphasis on confidentiality of **Deakin IP**.

---

## 7. LLM & Feedback Flow Adjustments
- **LLM Team Shift:** From fine-tuning to prompt engineering due to resource constraints.
- **Feedback Generation Flow:**
  1. Student submits work  
  2. Chat logs + prompt history stored  
  3. Feedback generated  
  4. Tutor reviews  
  5. Final feedback given to student  
- Student should **not** see similarity scores or feedback directly unless future direction changes.

---

## 8. Use Case & Access Control
- Updated use case diagrams (shared by Negin and Kasfi):
  - **Phase 1:** Educator-focused workflows only
  - **Phase 2:** Adds student interactions, feedback viewing, and AI-score visibility
- Authorization levels to distinguish between educator and student access.

---

## 9. Next Steps
- Mohtashim to create a **GitHub Contribution Guide** (Markdown format) for all current and future teams.
- All documentation must go through the established **PR + review + Netlify deploy** cycle.
- Teams to begin prototyping within educator-only scope using **OnTrack**.
