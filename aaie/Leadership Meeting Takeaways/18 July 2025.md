---

## **Key Discussion Points**  

### **1. Team Allocation & Flowchart**  
- Final AAIE student count confirmed: **28 members**.  
- Further discussion with Morgaine and Nebula required.  
- Proposed allocation: 3 sub-teams — 10 in LLM, 9 each in the other two pillars.  
- Flowchart to be created for **Task 2.1P** to visualise team structure & responsibilities.  

---

### **2. Task 2.1 Planning**  
- Each team to create a **proposal draft** in a **shared format** (objectives, goals, deliverables).  
- Combined **final project document** to be compiled from all 3 pillar drafts.  
- **Deadline for drafts:** 10 PM tonight.  

---

### **3. LLM Team Scope**  
- Responsibilities:  
  - Fine-tuning models for **AI detection** and **feedback generation**.  
  - API development for product integration.  
  - Tokenizer strategy + evaluation metric setup (BLEU, F1).  
- Initial focus: fine-tuning **pre-trained mini models** (e.g., TinyLLaMA).  
- Long-term: build model from scratch in **2026 onwards**.  

---

### **4. Collaboration Across Teams**  
- **Data Curation team** to share:  
  - Sample dataset aligned to final schema by **Week 4**.  
  - Full dataset (~1000 entries) by **Week 8**.  
- **Product team** expects:  
  - AI Detection API  
  - Feedback Generation API  
  - Structured Response Format for frontend integration  
  - APIs targeted for delivery by **Week 8**.  

---

### **5. Tooling Decisions**  
- **GitHub** chosen over GitLab (better integration, fewer login issues).  
- **Microsoft Planner** for cross-team task management.  
- Suggestion to use **Lovable** for quick frontend prototyping.  
- Deakin-paid tools like Trello or Monday.com may not be available.  

---

### **6. Dataset Scale & Labels**  
- Minimum **1000 labelled samples** required for effective model training.  
- Dataset labels: **Human**, **AI-generated**, **Hybrid**.  
- Recommendation: over-sample AI & Hybrid (60:40 split) for better detection accuracy.  

---

### **7. Ethics & Data Compliance**  
- No Deakin student data usage without **formal ethics approval**.  
- Rubrics may be sourced from educators for feedback training.  
- Emphasis on **PII compliance** and **ethical AI** across datasets & tools.  

---

## **Decisions Made**  
- All pillar drafts to follow the **same format**, shared by end of day.  
- Final integrated document will include:  
  - Overview of AAIE project  
  - Objectives & deliverables for each sub-team  
  - Member structure flowchart  
- All teams begin research **Week 3**.  
- Data Curation to share demo data by mid-Week 4.  
- APIs to be ready by **Week 8**.  
- Product Design to focus on frontend until APIs are ready.
