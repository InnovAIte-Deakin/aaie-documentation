# Mentor Meeting Summary Notes

**Date:** 14 July 2025  

---

## Team Introductions & Goals

- All team members introduced themselves, sharing:
  - Current course and year level
  - Prior experience with AI, ML, or LLMs
  - Target grade
  - Interest in pursuing a leadership role
- A large number of students expressed interest in distinction or high distinction, meaning leadership roles and technical responsibility.

---

## Mentor’s Expectations & Project Direction

### 1. Communication & Work Ethic
- Communication should be clear, concise, and jargon-free considering this is a real project simulation.
- Students are expected to be honest about their capacity and not overcommit, especially in leadership tracks.
- Blocking teammates or neglecting tasks leads to a negative impact on grades; responsible collaboration is essential.

### 2. Grade Pathways
- **High Distinction (HD):** Outstanding leadership, initiative, deep technical or project contributions.  
  Students must commit early to their grade goals as getting an HD is not easy and requires active contribution from week 1.
- **Distinction (D):** Clear leadership, ownership of responsibilities, consistent progress.
- **Credit (C):** Solid team participation and follow-through.

## Project Scope & Vision

**Overall Goal:**  
Create an AI-driven solution to assist educators in the assessment process, specifically:

1. **AI Detection** – Identify when a submission has been generated by AI tools or determine the percentage completed by AI (similar to Turnitin).
2. **Feedback Generation** – Provide structured, intelligent feedback to help educators mark more effectively.

> This project has no prior infrastructure — we are starting from scratch this trimester.

## Project Structure: 3 Main Pillars

### 1. Data Curation / Generation
- Sourcing and generating training and testing datasets for the LLMs.
- Focus on rubrics, sample assessments, annotated student work, and synthetic data creation.

**Challenges:**
- Limited access to real rubrics due to confidentiality.
- Need to simulate real-world academic tasks without compromising academic integrity.

**Team will explore:**
- Synthetic rubric generation
- Rubric-to-prompt data pipelines
- Labelling AI-generated vs human content

---

### 2. Model Development
- Training and fine-tuning LLMs for two tasks:
  - AI content detection (classification or scoring of AI-likeness)
  - Feedback generation (rubric-aligned comment generation)

**Also includes:**
- Evaluation loops and testing datasets
- Model versioning, CI/CD pipelines, eval frameworks (e.g., Weights & Biases, HuggingFace evals)
- Consideration of false positives and tutor trust

---

### 3. Product Engineering
- Building the actual interface/product that educators can use.
- Initially, this will be a standalone tool; later it may integrate with OnTrack, CloudDeakin, or similar systems.

**Includes:**
- Use case flows, wireframes, system diagrams
- Security features, API integrations, UI/UX planning
- Avoiding disruption to educator workflow (e.g., suggestion-style feedback instead of replacement)

## Leadership Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Product Lead (1 for each pillar)** | Shapes the vision for their stream (what to build, how, why). Writes proposals and strategy docs. |
| **Scrum Master (1 for each pillar)** | Manages sprints, breaks down large tasks, maintains sprint boards. Needs technical understanding. |
| **Leadership Liaison** | Represents the project in leadership weekly meetings. Maintains alignment across teams. |
| **Channel Lead** | Manages communication on MS Teams. Ensures queries and updates are seen and responded to. |
| **GitHub/GitLab Maintainer** | Sets up and manages version control, branching, reviews, and codebase hygiene. |
| **Product Owner Liaison** | Maintains stakeholder relationship with the PO. Coordinates with the scrum master to have an overview of the project progress and goals. |

---

## Timeline & Workflow Plan

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Week 1–2** | Introductions, team formation, role selection |
| **Week 3** | Research, proposal writing, initial setup (tools, repo, boards) |
| **Week 4+** | Sprints begin and start to build prototypes and models |

---

## Final Thoughts & Takeaways
- Students are expected to own their learning, collaborate actively, and balance ambition with realism.
- The team will ultimately produce models, systems, and workflows that could be extended beyond this unit as this is a **3-year project**.
