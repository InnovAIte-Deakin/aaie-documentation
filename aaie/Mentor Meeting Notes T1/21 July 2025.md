## 4. Data Pillar Updates
- **Three datasets planned:**
  1. **Submission Classification:** Distinguish between AI vs Human (Hybrid postponed for now).  
     - Goal: Initial 1–2K samples this week from public datasets.  
     - Mix of OpenAI-generated and open-source samples (e.g., from Kaggle).
  2. **Feedback Dataset:** Submission text + rubric + educator feedback.
  3. **Revision Chain Dataset:** Tracks iterative revisions; yet to be explored.

**Plan of action for Product Lead (Monique), Scrum Master (Lucy) and other tech leads:**
- Investigate data access from Deakin (for rubrics, feedback).
- Break down subtasks under storage, format, and preprocessing.
- Assign technical leadership roles for each dataset.

## 5. LLM Pillar Updates
- **Team Structure:** 4 focus areas — Tokenization, Fine-tuning, Model Training and Evaluation, API Development.

**Plan by Product Lead (Arnav), Scrum Master (Khushi) and other tech leads:**
- Start with a basic fine-tuned model (e.g., NanoGPT/TinyLLaMA).
- Evaluate using BLEU and F1 score.
- Provide API to product design team.
- Agree on API structure early to unblock frontend and backend development.

**Key Discussion:**
- Concerns about limited training data (1–2K samples) causing overfitting.
- Suggestion to introduce synthetic noise or data augmentation.
- Agreed to prioritize getting an end-to-end dev loop with a basic model running first.
