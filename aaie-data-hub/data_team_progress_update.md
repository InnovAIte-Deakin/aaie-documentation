# Data Curation & Generation – Mid-Trimester Update  

## Progress  
- Established **unified JSON schema** and validation tools to ensure dataset quality.  
- Implemented **GitHub workflows** with peer/senior reviews and automated CI checks.  
- Curated **20+ rubrics across 5 domains**, each with multi-quality submissions (Excellent → Poor).  
- Developed **synthetic submission pipelines** with prompt engineering to expand data efficiently.  
- Introduced **weighted rubrics** and varied **feedback types** to better reflect real assessment practices.  

## Changes to Plan  
- Shifted focus from rapid mass-curation to **depth and schema quality first**, ensuring a strong foundation.  
- Plan revised to scale from **100 JSONs to 1000+** by trimester end, using automation and standardized templates.  
- Added priority on **coverage analysis tools** to highlight gaps in domains, rubrics, and quality levels.  

## New Plans & Aims  
- Develop **automated scripts** for large-scale submission generation while maintaining rubric alignment.  
- Introduce **reporting dashboards** to monitor dataset coverage and quality balance across domains.  
- Expand into **revision chains** to model multi-turn student–LLM interactions.  
- Finalize **1000+ curated and reviewed entries** as a milestone deliverable.
