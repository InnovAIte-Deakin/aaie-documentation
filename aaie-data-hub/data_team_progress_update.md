# Data Curation & Generation – Mid-Trimester Update  

## Progress  
- Established **unified JSON schema** and validation tools to ensure dataset quality.  
- Implemented **GitHub workflows** with peer/senior reviews and automated CI checks.  
- Curated **100+ rubrics across 5 domains**, each with multi-quality submissions (Excellent → Poor).  
- Developed **synthetic submission pipelines** with prompt engineering to expand data efficiently.  
- Introduced **weighted rubrics** and varied **feedback types** to better reflect real assessment practices.  

## Changes to Original Plan  
- Shifted from **quantity-first** to **quality-first** approach (depth, schema compliance, peer review).  
- Changed from three separate dataset types (**classifier, feedback, revision**) into **one unified dataset**.  
- Revised target: scale to **1000 rubrics (≈8000 submissions)** by trimester end using automation.  
- Changed strategy from sourcing public datasets to **generation-only approach** (synthetic + human-style submissions).  

## New Plans & Aims  
- Develop dataset that includes **weighted rubrics** and varied **feedback types** to better reflect real assessment practices.  
- Develop **automated scripts** for large-scale submission generation while maintaining rubric alignment.  
- Introduce **reporting dashboards** to monitor dataset coverage and quality balance across domains.  
- Expand into **revision chains** to model multi-turn student–LLM interactions.  
- Finalize **1000+ curated and reviewed entries** as a milestone deliverable.
