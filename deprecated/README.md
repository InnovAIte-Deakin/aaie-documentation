# Deprecated Folder: Archive of Early Work

This folder contains **archived documentation and planning material** created **before the AAIE GitHub repositories and workflows were fully established**.

> **WARNING: This folder is deprecated.**  
> The files and structure here **do not reflect the latest documentation standards, workflows, or schema updates** for the AAIE project.

## Purpose

This folder exists for **historical reference only**, to preserve early work from the Data Curation, LLM, and Product teams during the initial phases of planning. It may include:

- Deprecated flowcharts, diagrams, or contributor guides
- Initial JSON schemas or dataset structure ideas
- Strategy documents prior to alignment across teams

## Do Not Use in Active Development

All current documentation and workflows are maintained in the main repo folder and should follow the approved standards.

> Please refer to the `development` branch of the [AAIE Documentation repository](https://github.com/InnovAIte-Deakin/aaie-documentation/tree/development) for the most up-to-date instructions, documentation, and plans.
