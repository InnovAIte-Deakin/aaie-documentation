# Deprecated – Weekly Workflow and Automation Plan

> **This workflow plan is deprecated.**  
> It was part of the initial planning phase for team sprints and meetings before the final GitHub-based workflow were implemented.

## Original Weekly Workflow Plan

This weekly loop was designed to keep the team aligned, deliver consistent updates to Nebula, and ensure continuous progress through sprint planning, midweek check-ins, and retrospective evaluations.

### Weekly Meeting Cycle

| Day      | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Saturday** | Sprint Review & Planning: Finalise tasks, review previous sprint, reassign or carry over as needed |
| **Monday**   | TLDR Update to Nebula: Share what was done and what's next from Saturday |
| **Wednesday**| Midweek Check-In with Nebula: Raise blockers, report progress, individual updates |

## Expectations and Communication Culture

- Be transparent about your **availability, goals, and limitations**
- If unsure how to progress or feeling overloaded, **reach out early**
- **Don’t be a blocker** — reassign tasks if you can’t complete them
- If you’re stuck, **ask for help** from leads or teammates
