# LLM Team Scrum Meeting Takeaways  
**Date:** 23 July 2025  

---

## Team & Roles  
- **Scrum Master:** Leads scrum meetings and coordinates the planner board.  
- **New Roles Added:**  
  - **Documentation Lead(s):** Responsible for centralized project documentation and communications.  
  - **Visualization Team:** Helps explain model structure visually before PO meeting.  

---

## Project Management & Task Planning  
- Separate Planner Board created for the LLM team (not yet merged with AAIE master board).  
- **Nebula’s Direction:**  
  - All teams should migrate to the main AAIE project board with standard labelling.  
  - Each team member must have a clearly assigned task they own individually.  
  - Cards must include a “deliverable” section — defines task completion.  
  - Create a “Big Tasks” bucket for large items needing breakdown.  
  - Introduce backlog grooming to refine tasks continuously.  

---

## Infrastructure & Setup  
- GitHub chosen as final version control system over GitLab.  
- **Repo Setup:** Mohtashim will set up GitHub repositories.  
- **Documentation Tooling:** Assigned to Khushi — to explore **Netlify + Astro**-based pipeline (inspired by Thought Tech's Doubtfire repo).  
- Khushi and Mohtashim to collaboratively plan GitHub structure.

## Workstream Planning  
- **Focus This Week:**  
  1. Documentation  
  2. Visualization  
  3. Tokenization Strategy  

- **Fine-Tuning Timeline:**  
  - To begin in Week 5 (dataset expected by end of Week 4).  

- **Pre-Fine-tuning Research Tasks:**  
  - Create 3 research tasks on LLM candidates:  
    - **NanoGPT**  
    - **TinyLLaMA**  
    - Third model to be proposed by Ed (lead)  
  - Each research task must include:  
    - Model explanation  
    - Required resources  
    - 3–5 pros/cons  
    - Clearly defined deliverable  

- **Tokenization Research Areas:**  
  - Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)  
  - SentencePiece  
  - Unigram LM  
  - WordPiece  

- **Additional Deliverables:**  
  - System Architecture for AI Detection and Feedback Generation  
  - Evaluation Document proposal for selecting evaluation metrics  

---

## Leadership & Task Allocation  
- Members assigned based on preferences (two per person), leadership interests respected.  
- **Guidelines:**  
  - Avoid task duplication where possible.  
  - Leaders act as facilitators, not dictators.  
  - Students can approach Nebula if blocked from opportunities.  

---

## Immediate Follow-ups & Clarifications  
- **GPU Credit Concern:** Raised by Arnav regarding fine-tuning larger models and GPU access (Google Colab, University).  
  - Nebula advised adding to leadership meeting agenda — coordinated by Yashica.
