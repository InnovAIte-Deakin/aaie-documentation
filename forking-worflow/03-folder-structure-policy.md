# Folder Structure Setup

- Each Team Lead is responsible for setting up the folder structure relevant to their domain.
- Before starting any work:
  - Submit a Pull Request (PR) with only the folder structure.
  - Do **not** include any code or documentation files.
  - This PR will be fast-tracked for mentor approval.
