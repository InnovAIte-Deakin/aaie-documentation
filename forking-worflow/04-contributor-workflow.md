# Contributor Workflow

Steps for all contributors:

1. **Fork** the full repository (not just the main branch).
2. **Create a local feature branch** in your fork (e.g., `feature/model-evaluation`).
3. **Work locally** using the correct folder structure defined by your team lead.
4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Base: `development` branch of the main repo
   - Compare: your feature branch
   - Add a meaningful title and description for your changes.
