# Repository Structure & Branching Policy

- The `main` branch is protected and will remain empty.
- Only the mentor (Nebula Alam) has merge access to `development`.
- All development work must be directed to the `development` branch.
- `main` will be synced with `development` only at defined milestones (e.g., mid-trimester, final release).
