# General Guidelines and Enforcement

-  Do not submit PRs to the `main` branch â€” this is strictly prohibited.
-  Contact your team lead if unsure about any step.
-  This structure is enforced throughout the trimester.
- Following this process helps avoid merge conflicts, improves traceability, and ensures long-term maintainability for future teams.
